# Alarm system on Atmega8|DS1307|EEPROM

Automated the bell system for a college using an ATmega8 microcontroller, DS1307 RTC, and LCD 1602. The device was capable of ringing bells according to multiple
schedules and saving settings in EEPROM. This project demonstrated my skills in electronics and embedded
system programming and represents a practical application of microcontroller technology and hardware design.
